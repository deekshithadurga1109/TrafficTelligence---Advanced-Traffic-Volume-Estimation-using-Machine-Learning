# TrafficTelligence---Advanced-Traffic-Volume-Estimation-using-Machine-Learning
This project, TrafficTelligence, presents a machine learning-based approach to estimating traffic volume using historical traffic and weather data. By analyzing temporal, meteorological, and holiday-based factors, our model can accurately predict traffic flow.
